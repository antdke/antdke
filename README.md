### Hi there 👋

#### 📌 10-second bio
I’m an entrepreneur and creator at heart: I’ve built [video chat](https://chatparty.co) and [live streaming](https://twitter.com/hinotehq) apps, started [a newsletter](https://theproductperson.com), “The Product Person” to share insights on product and design, and I’ve been operating as a product manager the last 10 months at a start-up, [Blissfully.com](https://blissfully.com).
