### Yo! 👋

### ⏱ Quick bio:

I’m an entrepreneur and creator. I [sold my first business](https://antdke.co/posts/sold) at 21.

I started [a newsletter](https://www.producthunt.com/products/the-product-person) business called “The Product Person” to share insights on product and design that grew to over 5,000 paying and free subscribers when I sold it. It's been read by product teams at companies like Dropbox, Nike, and Figma. 

My last 2 roles were in Product. Most recently, at a16z-backed Series B fintech startup, [Extra Card](https://extra.app). Before that, I did product work at a B2B SaaS startup, [Blissfully.com, (Now, Vendr)](https://vendr.com).
